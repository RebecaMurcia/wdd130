                    <h3>North Santiam River</h3>
                    <p>With its convenient location near Salem and Portland the North Santiam 
                        river rafting trip offers great introductory whitewater.  With clear water 
                        during the summertime there is lots of swimming chances and moments for relaxation.  
                        The mild rapids are still splashy and exciting enough with Spencer's Hole, Carnivore 
                        and Mill City Falls, its a river rafting trip suitable for everyone.</p>

                    <h3>North Umpqua River</h3>
                    <p> Tucked near the base of Crater Lake, the North Umpqua River
                    certainly has a lot to offer when it comes to whitewater action.  
                    With multiple options for a variety of runs, from consistent class II+ rapids 
                    to spaced out bigger class III+ rapids, we think the North Umpqua river is some 
                    of the finest whitewater in the state.</p>
