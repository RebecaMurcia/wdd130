                    <p>The Clackamas River rafting is Portland's 
                    most accessible white water river adventure and a great way to experience
                    the thrilling outdoors of Oregon. Being nestled under Mt Hood & Mt Jefferson

                    Your Deschutes River rafting trip is full of sun, big splashy waves and boiling rapids. 
                    Nestled in a desert river canyon, near the town of Maupin; the Deschutes River not only

                    <h3>McKenzie River</h3>
                    <p>The McKenzie River is an Oregon classic for rafters and for good reason.  
                        With crystal clear water swiftly moving by a tree lined river bank full 
                        of fun rapids the excitement never stops on this scenic rafting trip.  
                        You can choose between two different sections, the upper and lower which both offer 
                        mild but consistent rapids, great for family trips. </p>

                    <h3>North Santiam River</h3>
                    <p>With its convenient location near Salem and Portland the North Santiam 
                        river rafting trip offers great introductory whitewater.  With clear water 
                        during the summertime there is lots of swimming chances and moments for relaxation.  
                        The mild rapids are still splashy and exciting enough with Spencer's Hole, Carnivore 
                        and Mill City Falls, its a river rafting trip suitable for everyone.</p>

                    <h3>North Umpqua River</h3>
                    <p> Tucked near the base of Crater Lake, the North Umpqua River
                    certainly has a lot to offer when it comes to whitewater action.  
                    With multiple options for a variety of runs, from consistent class II+ rapids 
                    to spaced out bigger class III+ rapids, we think the North Umpqua river is some 
                    of the finest whitewater in the state.</p>
